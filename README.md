# Garbage Oracle Vim Theme

**[See it on vim colours](http://vimcolors.com/949/garbage-oracle/light)**

Generated by [Themer](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer)  
Contrasting colours chosen by [Tanaguru Contrast Finder](https://github.com/Tanaguru/Contrast-Finder)  
Palette inspired by the [Goddess Mode comic series](https://www.dccomics.com/comics/goddess-mode-2018/goddess-mode-1)  

## Configuration

```vim
set background=dark " set background=light to load light version
colorscheme garbage-oracle
let g:lightline = { " if you use itchyny/lightline.vim for your statusline 
      \ 'colorscheme': 'GarbageOracle',
      \ }
syntax enable
```
### Italics Support
This theme supports italics for code comments;  since not all terminals support italics this is something you'll have to enable in your vim configuration if you want to use it with your italics friendly terminal:

```vim
" Enable italicized coments
let g:garbage_terminal_italics=1
```
